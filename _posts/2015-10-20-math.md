The interesting thing that we are going to introduce here is the basis of natural logarithm, or for short, which was discovered by the Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler in the 18th century. This surprising number, with an approximate value of 2.718, may not be as famous as pi. But the number, like its rival, has its own day. People of science have chosen February 7 to honor this strange thing.
If you want count it for yorself you can use this formula :
$$
\sum_{k=1}^\infty 1/k!
$$

The base of the natural logarithm is often used in equations related to logarithms, exponential growth, and complex numbers. Keith Devlin, director of the Stanford Graduate School of Mathematics Outreach Project, believes that: This number has an extraordinary definition according to which the exponential function y=e^x has a value equal to its slope at any point. In other words, if the value of a function at a point is equal to 7.5, its slope (or derivative) at that point will also be equal to 7.5. Just like its other competitors, this number is widely used in mathematics, physics and engineering.
